  Blockchain & FullStack Engineer 
</h3>

<p>

  I have 12 years of experience worked with a variety of companies including small startups and big communities, which made me intimately familiar with all the stages of the web lifecycle from the initial architecture to final deployment.
  
  I have extensive knowledge of front-end JavaScript as well as significant experience with popular frameworks and libraries like React/Redux, Angular, and Vue. 
  
  My deep full-stack experience includes Node.js and Express, MongoDB as well as more traditional technologies like PHP, and MySQL.
  
  Recently, I have worked on several cryptocurrency projects piling up great knowledge on Blockchain tech. 
  
  I am also not new to the remote freelancing scene, so I am extremely flexible with any working hours.
